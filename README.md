# Soil Recipe Calculator

As any gardener knows, having the right soil is vital to any successful plant growth. After learning of several different soil recipes, I discovered most of them were listed as ratios, or in parts. Calculating how much of each ingredient is needed takes time and is error prone, so I built this tool to do it for us.

You can also view this tool on my personal website at samueleddy.com/garden-tools

HOW TO USE:
1. Input the amount of soil you need and select the units. If you're using a container, the volume should be listed somewhere on it, and if you're using a raised bed, the volume should be on the packaging. 
2. Click 'add ingredient' until you have a row for each ingredient in your soil recipe. To delete a row, simply select the checkbox for that row and press 'delete ingredient'. 
3. Next, input the number of parts for each ingredient.
4. When you're finished, click the calculate button, and you'll find out exactly you much you need of each ingredient.
